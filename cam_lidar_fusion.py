# For each camera
    # For each keypoint
        # Get lidar nearest neighbors
        # Track if there is valid nearest neighbor cluster
        # Depth binning
        # Get centroids

# Get valid cluster pairs (both keypoints should have lidar neighbors)

# 3D keypoints from vision-lidar

# 3D keypoints from lidar pointcloud

# Build consistency matrix

# Solve consistency graph

# Plot lidar points

# Plot centroids
